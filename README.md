## Project setup

### Download project repository to your local directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SPM-LMS-T6/project-SBRPg8t6.git
```

### Set up .env

Fill in the values for the variable

### Navigate to Client Directory:

```sh
cd client
```

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Docker Compose (Build & Compose)

```sh
docker compose build; docker compose up -d;
```
